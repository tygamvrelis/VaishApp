# VaishApp
Countdown application for Windows desktops. This program was good multithreading practice for me because I had to make sure the UI wouldn't freeze with each tick of the countdown. I also created it to solidify XAML knowledge I was gaining through an introductory Pluralsight course.

You can open the calendar and interactively select a date to load the timer with.
You can then save this timer onto your machine, and load it from a dropdown menu the next time you start the app.
